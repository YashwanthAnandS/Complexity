1.Time Complexity (Time to execute the program)
    - Operations
    - Comparisons
    - Loop Stuff
    - Pointer references
    - Function calls

2.Space Complexity (Space Occupied by the program)
    - Variables
    - Data Structures
    - Allocations
    - Function call


    Time Complexity inversely proportional to the Space Complexity
